# Pretty Instagram Story Example

## Changelog

* Cubits and views renamed.
* Before cubit naming is kind a complicated and difficult to identify them, now top cubit is StoryHeadCubit and each story's cubit is StoryBucketCubit.
* Logic parts simplified.
* Gesture logic moved to GestureBehaviorer widget and its logic shortened as possible with keeping intended physic behaviours.
* Cubic animation moved to CubicAnimationWidget.
* PageChangeNotifier removed, instead PageControllers itself has used as notifier.
* Stateful widgets removed except main page and storyViewItem pages due to ticker dependencies.
* Variable naming refreshed.
* **There was models for story datas which are StoryBucket and StoryItem.** As new, User model added to StoryBucket. As design choice User model kept under StoryBucket model.
* Error logs due to video controller's wrong disposal has resolved.
* Fast transition video non-starting cases has resolved. Simple test video has uploaded at bottom.


##Discussion

* On android(my physical device(jason-crDroid7.31-android11)) has still logging ```E/Surface : freeAllBuffers: 6 buffers were freed while being dequeued!``` from video_player package's android backend player ExoPlayer. Through my tests, it log that line whenever I dispose controller even it is unused. I have assumed it as non-important log as it always doing it on my device.
* Above logs release point is [Surface.cpp](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/native/+/master/libs/gui/Surface.cpp#2304) on android.
* Binding animationController to videoController is help to get rid of **SingleTickerProviderStateMixin** dependency on Stateful Widget. In my design I only kept current video controller, and one animation controller. Also I want to keep showing images with AssetImage instead of video player. So I stick with Stateful Widget.

## ~~Unproblematic Downside~~ Has Resolved

* ~~When you pretend to swipe from the current story to another story without lifting the finger and return to the current story, the current story stays in a paused state. If you press and pull the finger back, the story continues. Or you can click right or left to go back and forth. It is a situation that I do not want to happen, but it does not cause any problems to the user.~~
* Demo videos are old ones.
