# Pretty Instagram Story Example


## Features
* Cubic transition between story groups
* Auto video timing animation with time bar
* Story group swiping with sliding screen
* Catch where you left on previosly watched story groups.
* Watched stories marked but not used as functionality, it could be use for further developments.
* After quit the story view, auto sort the story groups.
* Unfinished story groups have green border.
* Finished ones have grey and at end.
* Pause/Continue with hold and release touches. 
<br />



## Unproblematic Downside

* When you pretend to swipe from the current story to another story without lifting the finger and return to the current story, the current story stays in a paused state. If you press and pull the finger back, the story continues. Or you can click right or left to go back and forth. It is a situation that I do not want to happen, but it does not cause any problems to the user.
